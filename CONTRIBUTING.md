# Contribution Guidelines

Unfortunately we cannot accept contributions right now.

## Legal

You will need to complete a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/x-software-com/sancus) before your pull request can be accepted. This agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the source code you are submitting, and that this work is being submitted under appropriate license that we can use it.

You can complete the CLA by opening a pull request. Once the CLA is signed, the pull request will be reviewed. You will only need to do this once.
